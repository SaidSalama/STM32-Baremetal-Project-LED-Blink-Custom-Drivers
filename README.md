# STM32-Baremetal-Project-LED-Blink-Custom-Drivers
This is a bare-metal embedded project for the STM32F103C8T6 (Blue Pill) board. The goal isn't just to blink an LED â€” it's to learn how embedded systems work at the lowest level by writing everything from scratch: startup code, linker script, Makefile, and hardware drivers (RCC, SysTick, GPIO).
